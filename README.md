Kelly Bombardieri Portfolio Page

# About the Project
This project is a portfolio page I designed for myself to create a hub where I can upload all of my work, for future potential employers to see 
what I have created, all in one place. It gives a brief description about me, includes an image and has all of my current works linked with images. 
I then have created a contact me section which includes my phone number, email address and link to my GitHub account. 
For this project I decided to go with a blue and pink colour scheme as it matches the image I selected. There is an interactive header which will drop down to the labeled sections of the page i.e. "About Me" "Work" and "Contact Me". I have also used flexbox to create the layout and to make the webpae responsive to all screen sizes.
